# GitHub Repository Setup Guide
## Creating a Private Repository for GoQuant Submission

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a private GitHub repository for your Trade Simulator project submission to GoQuant.

## Step 1: Create a New Repository

1. Log in to your GitHub account
2. Click on the '+' icon in the top-right corner and select 'New repository'
3. Enter a repository name (e.g., 'goqt-trade-simulator')
4. Add a description: "A real-time trade simulator that leverages WebSocket market data to estimate transaction costs and market impact for cryptocurrency trading."
5. Select 'Private' to make the repository private
6. Check the box to initialize the repository with a README
7. Click 'Create repository'

## Step 2: Clone the Repository Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/goqt-trade-simulator.git
cd goqt-trade-simulator
```

## Step 3: Add Project Files

1. Copy your project files into the cloned repository directory
2. Organize files according to the expected structure:

```

├── requirements.txt         # Project dependencies
├── README.md               # Project documentation
├── models/                 # Model implementations
│   ├── almgren_chriss.py   # Market impact model
│   ├── slippage.py         # Slippage estimation models
│   └── maker_taker.py      # Maker/Taker proportion prediction
├── data/                   # Data handling
│   ├── websocket_client.py # WebSocket connection and data streaming
│   └── orderbook.py        # Orderbook data structure and processing
├── ui/                     # User interface components
│   ├── main_window.py      # Main application window
│   ├── input_panel.py      # Input parameters panel
│   ├── output_panel.py     # Results display panel
│   └── style.py            # UI styling and themes
├── utils/                  # Utility functions
│   ├── config.py           # Configuration management
│   ├── logger.py           # Logging functionality
│   └── performance.py      # Performance monitoring
└── docs/                   # Documentation
    ├── architecture.md     # System architecture documentation
    ├── models.md           # Model documentation and mathematics
    └── code_implementation.md # Implementation details
```

## Step 4: Add and Commit Files

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with complete Trade Simulator implementation"
git push origin main
```

## Step 5: Add GoQuant Team as Collaborators

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on 'Settings'
3. Select 'Collaborators' from the left sidebar
4. Click 'Add people'
5. Enter the GitHub usernames provided by GoQuant
6. Select each user and click 'Add collaborator'

## Step 6: Verify Repository Access

1. Log out of your GitHub account
2. Open an incognito/private browsing window
3. Try to access your repository URL
4. Verify that the repository is not publicly accessible

## Step 7: Share Repository Link

1. Copy your repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/your-username/goqt-trade-simulator)
2. Include this link in your submission email to GoQuant

## Additional Tips

- Make sure all code is properly commented and documented
- Include a comprehensive README.md file
- Ensure all required documentation is included in the docs/ directory
- Verify that the repository structure matches the expected format
- Test that all code runs correctly before submitting

Following these steps will ensure that your GitHub repository is properly set up for submission to GoQuant.
