# Trade Simulator Architecture

## System Overview

The Trade Simulator is designed as a modular application that processes real-time market data to estimate transaction costs and market impact for cryptocurrency trading. The system architecture follows a clean separation of concerns with distinct components for data handling, modeling, and user interface.

## Component Architecture

### Data Layer

- **WebSocket Client**: Establishes and maintains connections to exchange WebSocket APIs
- **Orderbook**: Maintains the current state of the market orderbook and provides methods for analysis

### Model Layer

- **Almgren-Chriss Model**: Implements the mathematical model for estimating market impact
- **Slippage Estimation**: Calculates expected slippage based on orderbook depth and trade size
- **Maker/Taker Proportion**: Predicts the proportion of orders that will be executed as maker vs. taker

### UI Layer

- **Main Window**: Primary application container and layout manager
- **Input Panel**: Provides controls for adjusting simulation parameters
- **Output Panel**: Displays simulation results and visualizations

### Utility Layer

- **Configuration**: Manages application settings and parameters
- **Logging**: Handles application logging and error reporting
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks and reports on application performance metrics

## Data Flow

1. The WebSocket client connects to exchange APIs and streams real-time orderbook data
2. The Orderbook component processes and organizes this data into a structured format
3. When the user inputs trade parameters, the model components analyze the current orderbook state
4. The models calculate expected costs, slippage, and market impact
5. Results are displayed in the UI's Output Panel
6. Performance metrics are continuously logged for analysis

## Design Patterns

- **Observer Pattern**: Used for propagating orderbook updates to interested components
- **Strategy Pattern**: Employed for implementing different cost models
- **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating appropriate model instances based on configuration

## Performance Considerations

- **Data Processing Efficiency**: Optimized algorithms for orderbook updates and analysis
- **UI Responsiveness**: Separate thread for UI updates to prevent blocking
- **Memory Management**: Efficient data structures to minimize memory usage
- **Latency Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of internal processing latency

## Scalability

The architecture is designed to scale in the following ways:

- **Multiple Exchange Support**: The system can be extended to support additional exchanges
- **Additional Models**: New cost models can be added without modifying existing code
- **Distributed Processing**: The architecture can be adapted for distributed processing of large data volumes
