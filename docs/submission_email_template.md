Dear GoQuant Team,

I am pleased to submit my completed Trade Simulator assignment. I have implemented a real-time trade simulator that leverages WebSocket market data to estimate transaction costs and market impact for cryptocurrency trading.

The video provides a comprehensive overview of my implementation, including the architecture, code walkthrough, and live demonstration of the simulator in action.

**Key Features of My Implementation**:

- Real-time processing of WebSocket market data from OKX
- Implementation of the Almgren-Chriss market impact model
- Accurate estimation of slippage based on orderbook depth
- Prediction of maker/taker proportion for fee calculation
- Responsive UI for parameter adjustment and result visualization
- Performance monitoring and optimization

I have thoroughly tested the application and ensured that all requirements have been met. The repository includes comprehensive documentation in the `docs/` directory, explaining the architecture, models, and implementation details.

Please let me know if you require any additional information or have any questions about my implementation.

Thank you for the opportunity to complete this assignment. I look forward to discussing my solution with you.

Best regards,
